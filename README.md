🧪 Question - Display user tokens of ERC1155

> We will create a smart contract inheriting the ERC1155 token. Once this smart contract is deployed user the owner will get some tokens in the his/her account. Later on using inherited smart contract methods we can easily find the user account balances. The only difference between this and ERC20 token is the balance variable is doubly mapped meaning it required id and account address to display the user balance.

## Where to find code

1. Go to packages/hardhat
2. Inside contracts you will ERC1155Token smart contract that inherit the ERC1155 smart contract 
3. Inside deploy folder in migration file we are calculating and logged the user balance
